Hi, I'm Dylan, but I'm also known online as Melmon.
I work as a frontend engineer, but I like to have a crack at anything that catches my fancy.

I write Typescript during the day and C after dark.
I have experience with Python, C++, Go and Java. I also like to create games with Godot.

I read Computer Science at the University of Bath.
I wrote my dissertation on reinforcement learning applications to the game Rogue using Deep Q-networks.

I love playing rhythm games, traditional roguelikes and SHMUPs.
I also like reading, piano, guitar and clay pigeon shooting.

Lucky Star is the greatest anime of all time~
