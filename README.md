Hi, I'm Dylan, but I'm also known online as Melmon.
I work as a frontend engineer, but I like to have a crack at anything that catches my fancy.

I have extensive experience in TypeScript (plus React) and Python (Django/Flask, TensorFlow).
I also have experience with C, C++, and I like to create games with Godot.
I'm currently learning Go, Zig and Rust.

I read Computer Science at the University of Bath.
I wrote my dissertation on reinforcement learning applications to the game Rogue using Deep Q-networks.

I love playing rhythm games, traditional roguelikes and SHMUPs.
I also like reading, piano and music production, gamedev, drawing, faffing around with Linux and clay pigeon shooting.

I use my GitHub account to mirror my repositories found at https://git.sr.ht/~melmon/.
I don't use social media, so the best way to contact me is through email. You can find my email on my website's contact page.
